**Woocommerce Online Price Inquiry**



With this plugin you can launch an online price inquiry system for your store.Just add your store products to the inquiry list. From now on, whenever a user enters the product page, Instead of adding to the shopping cart option, see the price inquiry option. by clicking on this option a message will be sent to you in the telegram bot as well as in the web version and the user page is expected to wait until admin answer the inquiry.

After you answer the user's inquiry and declare the new price, the new price is announced to the user and the **Add to the cart** option will appear again and the user can buy the product at the **new price** you set for the product.



If you don't respond within the specified time period, it will display a **contact form** to the user and ask him the contact information to call the user as soon as possible. You can determine how many hours after the price announcement، the user can **purchase** that product and If the user does not complete the purchase after that time, it will remove the product from user's cart and force the user to Resend inquiry request for products.



Or you can set the time for your shop so that it shows the contact form in the non-working hours instead of displaying the price inquiry timer.You can set a price until the end of the working hours, and since then, every user who requests the inquiry ,the price you once logged in ,will be shown to him and at the end of the working hours, all prices for that day will reset.
